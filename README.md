# VulkanEngine
A ongoing game engine using Vulkan. For the purposes of self-education. 

Much of this work began by following a tutorial series by [Brendan Galea](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8327DO66nu9qYVKLDmdLW_84-yE4auCR), but his series stopped right before lessons on textured meshes.
I have continued development to include an entity component system with a node based scene hierarchy and a minimally complete glTF importer. This is still in active development. 

## Future features planned include:
- PBR rendering
- Full glTF 2.0 feature support
- Animations
- Rigged/skinned meshes
- Rigid-body Physics
- Very basic scene outliner for in-engine editing.
